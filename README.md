# 🥗🏃‍♂️📊 Health & Longevity Analytics

A personal data analytics project exploring the relationship between **nutrition, physical activity, health, and longevity**.

The goal is to showcase a complete **Data Analyst workflow** using modern tools:

- Data ingestion and cleaning with **Spark** on **Databricks**
- Version control with **GitHub**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data transformation
- Building an **interactive dashboard** using Databricks SQL
- Communicating insights in a clear and visual way

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- [Databricks Community Edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/) – free Spark environment  
- **Python / PySpark** for data processing  
- **Databricks SQL Dashboard** for visualization  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control  
- (Optional) **Pandas / Matplotlib / Seaborn** for additional charts
